Part 1 - Unit Testing

Solutions are packed inside Exercise01.zip, Exercise02.zip and Exercise03.zip files.

Zip structure :

/Exercise01/main.cpp                 // standalone code for the exercise 1

/Exercise01/gtest/Exercise01         // gtest project for the exercise 1
           
/Exercise02/main.cpp                 // standalone code for the exercise 2

/Exercise02/gtest/Exercise02         // gtest project for the exercise 2

/Exercise03/main.cpp                 // standalone code for the exercise 3

/Exercise03/gtest/Exercise03         // gtest project for the exercise 3


Notes:

- Code edited, compiled and executed under CLion2020.3 for mac.
- gtest code edited, compiled and executed under Visual Studio Code for mac.
- all /Exercise0x/main.cpp files are reasonably self-explanatory.
- DEBUG definition can be uncommented for more traceability information during the execution.
